## The TACO specification

**_Current Version: 0.2.0 (Draft)_**

**Future versions must remain backward-compatible with this standard.**

The terms "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document follow the definitions from [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). The term "data user" refers to any individual or system accessing the data, "data provider" refers to the entity responsible for offering the data.

### Summary

Geospatial communities have long relied on standardised formats for raster and vector data, enabling interoperability, stable tool development, and long-term data preservation. In contrast, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-ready datasets, particularly those derived from Earth Observation (EO), lack equivalent conventions. As a result, data producers often adopt ad hoc file structures, loosely defined formats, and inconsistent semantic encodings. This fragmentation hinders interoperability, complicates reuse, and undermines reproducibility. We argue that the lack of a standard format represents a structural bottleneck to scalable scientific progress, especially in the era of foundation models, where diverse datasets must be combined for effective training and performance evaluation in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce TACO: a comprehensive specification that defines a formal data model, a cloud-optimized on-disk layout, and an API for creating and accessing AI-ready EO datasets.

### Introduction

The rapid increase in Earth Observation (EO) data, combined with advances in AI and cloud computing, has unlocked new opportunities for scientific discovery and operational monitoring (Montillet et al., 2024; Eyring et al., 2024; Hagos et al., 2022). Modern applications range from methane superemitter detection (Vaughan et al., 2024) and burned area estimation (Ribeiro et al., 2023) to biodiversity tracking (Yeh et al., 2021) and global-scale weather forecasting (Rasp et al., 2020; Bi et al., 2023). These efforts increasingly rely on data-driven models, which require large volumes of curated, structured, and accessible EO data (Re-
ichstein et al., 2019). However, preparing AI-ready EO datasets continues to be a significant challenge (Sambasivan et al., 2021; Francis & Czerkawski, 2024). Most datasets require extensive preprocessing and reformatting before being integrated into AI pipelines, and only a small fraction are usable “out of the box”. Although AI-ready EO datasets have grown substantially, with more than 500 now cataloged (Schmitt et al., 2023), they still lack a
unified structure and consistent metadata conventions. This fragmentation hinders reproducibility, limits interoperability, and slows the development of AI (Dimitrovski et al., 2023; Long et al., 2021). These issues are especially critical for training foundation models, which rely on combining diverse sources (Marsocci et al., 2024).

Insights from scientific communities can guide the development of standardised, AI-ready EO datasets. Fields such as climate science and geographic information systems (GIS) have long struggled with data standardisation and provide valuable lessons through widely adopted formats like NetCDF (Treinish & Gough, 1987; Rew & Davis, 1990) and GeoTIFF (Ritter & Ruth, 1997; Devys et al., 2019). NetCDF was initially created as a binary format for scientific data.
However, as its use has grown within the climate science community, it became evident that the existing specification did not sufficiently capture the complexity of domain-specific metadata. This realization led to the development of several metadata conventions, most notably the CF (Climate
and Forecast) Conventions (Eaton et al., 2024) aimed to standardise the description of scientific variables, coordinates, and attributes. Although these conventions significantly improved interoperability, their *text-based* definitions introduced ambiguities and made consistent implementation
difficult. To address this, formal data models, such as the CF data model (Hassell et al., 2017), were introduced years later, offering a structured and unambiguous interpretation of what CF-compliant data means. GeoTIFF, in contrast, took a more pragmatic approach. Designed to facilitate the exchange of raster data between GIS applications (Ritter & Ruth, 1997), GeoTIFF embeds minimal but critical metadata, specifically the coordinate reference system (CRS) and
geotransform, directly within the file (Devys et al., 2019). GeoTIFF, unlike NetCDF, was not developed with a comprehensive semantic model in mind. However, its simplicity and user-friendly design have led to widespread adoption.

In hindsight, both cases underscore the importance of maintainability. Crucially, both NetCDF and GeoTIFF have survived because active communities emerged around them, building tools, libraries, and practices that reinforced and extended the specifications over time (Devys et al., 2019; Maso et al., 2023; Eaton et al., 2024). For CF-compliant NetCDF datasets, the experience highlighted the limitations of relying only on text-based definitions: as the authors of the CF data model argue in their conclusion, “creating an explicit data model before the CF conventions were written would arguably have been preferable. A data model encourages coherent implementations, which could be file storage syntaxes or software codes” (Hassell et al., 2017). In contrast, GeoTIFF illustrates how a well-defined minimal standard focused on a specific use case can achieve broad interoperability without necessitating a complex data model. These lessons highlight the need to balance formal rigor with practical simplicity. Given the inherent complexity of AI-ready EO datasets, a formal data model is essential; however, whenever possible, it should be designed around the tools and workflows practitioners use on a daily basis to facilitate smooth adoption.

The FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016), Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability, provide a useful framework to systematically address the challenges faced by the AI-ready EO datasets. Regarding **Findability**, web standardised metadata schemas (i.e., Schema.org, Guha et al. 2016) are rarely used to describe AI-ready EO datasets, limiting their visibility in search engines and data catalogs (Benjelloun et al., 2024). In terms of **Accessibility**, data access often depends on manual downloads or custom APIs rather than scalable, cloud-native formats that support partial or selective retrieval. With respect to **Interoperability**, the wide variety of formats, with differing conventions for byte layout, chunking strategies, compression, and explicit metadata, creates barriers to seamless integration across datasets. Finally, on Reusability, many datasets lack clear licenses, provenance, or documentation, making them difficult to audit, cite, or extend.

To close these gaps, we propose TACO (Transparent Access to Cloud Optimized Datasets), a FAIR-compliant, cloud-optimized specification for organizing AI-ready EO datasets. TACO files are self-contained, portable, and complete, encapsulating all the information required for sample interpretation without relying on external files or software dependencies. Built on widely supported technologies like GDAL and Apache Parquet, TACO allows for seamless integration across multiple programming languages. The remainder of this paper presents the TACO specification in detail and outlines directions for future development.

The Data Model (A) is composed of two layers: Logical Structure (describing the relationships between data and metadata) and Semantic Description (standardised metadata definitions). These layers collectively define the Data Format (B), specifying how data is stored, which can be created and accessed through a dedicated API (C) consisting of the ToolBox (for creation) and the Reader (for reading).</figcaption>

### The specification

The TACO specification defines the data model, file format, and API (**Figure 1**). Here, the **_data model_** refers to an abstract representation of a dataset that defines the rules, constraints, and relationships connecting metadata to the associated data assets (**Figure 2**). The **_data format_** defines the physical representation of the dataset, specifying how data and metadata are encoded, stored, and organized. Finally, the API specifies the programmatic methods and conventions by which users and applications can interact with TACO-compliant datasets. By providing a unique and well-structured interface, the API abstracts the underlying complexity of the data format and data model, allowing data users to query, modify, and even integrate multiple TACO datasets.

#### The Data Model

The logical structure of the TACO data model is illustrated in the UML diagram in **Figure 2**. At its core, a TACO dataset is defined as a structured collection of minimal self-contained data units, called SAMPLEs, organized within a container, called TORTILLA, and enriched by dataset-level metadata.

</figure>

A SAMPLE represents the minimal self-contained and smallest indivisible unit for AI training and evaluation. Each SAMPLE encapsulates the actual data and metadata (**Figure 3**). Importantly, each SAMPLE contains a pointer to a DataSource that specifies how to access the underlying data. TACO supports three primary DataSource types: (i) GDALDataset, for raster or vector data readable by the GDAL library; (ii) BYTES, representing raw byte streams for unsupported or custom formats; and (iii) TORTILLA. While the BYTES option is available, GDALDataset is recommended for partial read support.

The TORTILLA serves as a container that manages multiple SAMPLE instances. All SAMPLEs within a TORTILLA share a uniform metadata schema, enabling the combined metadata to be represented as a dataframe. Since TORTILLA implements the DataSource interface, it can be referenced within a SAMPLE, enabling recursive nesting of TORTILLA containers. This design supports the representation of hierarchical datasets while preserving the modularity and self-contained nature of individual SAMPLEs.

Building upon TORTILLA, the TACO class extends this container structure by adding comprehensive dataset-level metadata (**Figure 4**). This additional metadata provides a semantic overview of the collection, supporting dataset management, discovery, and interoperability.

#### Semantic Description

This section defines the structure of the metadata associated with each individual SAMPLE (**Figure 3**) and with the TACO dataset (**Figure 4**) as a whole. Metadata is organized into three categories: (1) Core (required fields), (2) Optional (non-essential fields providing additional context or supporting specific functionalities), and (3) Automatic (fields automatically generated by the TACO API; generation is based exclusively on core metadata and never on optional fields).

At the `SAMPLE` level, two core attributes are required: `tortilla:id`, a unique string that identifies each `SAMPLE`, and `tortilla:file_format`, which specifies the data format—either `TORTILLA`, `BYTES`, or any format supported by GDAL. An optional field, `tortilla:data_split`, indicates the dataset partition to which the sample belongs (e.g., training, validation, or testing). Additionally, the fields `tortilla:offset` (denoting the position within a TORTILLA archive) and `tortilla:length` (the sample's size) are automatically computed by the TACO API (**Table 1**). The current specification supports three optional metadata extensions: STAC, Responsible AI (RAI), and sample statistics (STATS), which are described in detail in the `SAMPLE` Extensions section.

At the dataset level, TACO defines a `Metadata` class that encapsulates both core and optional fields describing the dataset’s provenance, structure, and content (**Table 1**). Core fields include a persistent identifier (`id`), versioning information (`taco_version`, `dataset_version`), spatiotemporal coverage (`extent`), a human-readable description (`description`), licensing details (`licenses`), and contact information for both dataset providers (`providers`) and the individual responsible for converting the data into TACO (`data_curator`). Several of these core fields employ nested structures or lists to represent complex information. For example, both `providers` and `data_curator` are modeled as lists of `Contact` objects (**Table 2**), each containing attributes such as name, affiliation, and email. The `extent` field (**Table 3**) uses nested list structures to capture spatial and temporal bounds, while the `licenses` field is represented by a `Licenses` class that can wrap one or more license entries.

Optional fields in the `Metadata` class include a dataset title, descriptive keywords, and high-level information about intended use, such as the task type (**Table 4**) and split strategy (**Table 5**). Links to external resources can be provided via the optional `raw_link` and `discuss_link` fields, both represented by a `Hyperlink` class that includes an `href` and a textual `description` (**Table 6**). TACO metadata is designed to be extensible: additional modules can be integrated by inheriting from an abstract `Extension` class. Version 0.2.0 of the specification supports three such extensions at the dataset level: Responsible AI (RAI), Publications, and Sensor metadata (**Table 7**, **Table 8**, and **Table 9**, respectively).

#### Data format

The **TORTILLA** and **TACO** file formats are designed for efficient storage of large-scale datasets using a binary serialization scheme (Figure \ref{fig\:file\_format}). Each TORTILLA file enforces a consistent schema and metadata structure across all its samples. Metadata is stored in the **FOOTER** using Apache Parquet, while the corresponding sample data is stored as a Binary Large Object (**BLOB**). Each row in the Apache Parquet file corresponds to a distinct `SAMPLE` object. The **BLOB** and the **FOOTER** are combined into a single file, constituting the TORTILLA format (see Figure \ref{fig\:file\_format}). Notably, the format enables partial reads of the **BLOB** during sample-level access, while the **FOOTER** is read entirely only once at load time.

A **TACO** file extends the TORTILLA format by appending dataset-level metadata (the **COLLECTION**), encoded in JSON at the end of the file. This design ensures that both TORTILLA and TACO files are self-contained, portable, and complete—encapsulating all information required to interpret samples without reliance on external files or software dependencies.

Each file begins with a fixed 200-byte **HEADER** that includes a 2-byte magic number, an 8-byte offset and length for the **FOOTER**, and an 8-byte data partition count that indicates how many segments the dataset contains. This count allows the TACO API to verify dataset completeness and reconstruct the full archive correctly. TACO files introduce two additional 8-byte fields for the **COLLECTION** offset and length. Both formats reserve unused space in the header for future use: 174 bytes in TORTILLA and 158 bytes in TACO.

The TACO API (Section \ref{sec\:api}) automatically generates certain fields based on the input data. For instance, it records sample-level offsets and lengths as columns in the **FOOTER**, enabling efficient random access to individual samples (illustrated by the red dotted line in Figure \ref{fig\:file\_format}). To support multi-language interoperability and partial reads, TACO relies on GDAL’s Virtual File System (VFS), particularly the `/vsisubfile/` handler, which allows byte ranges within a TACO file to be treated as standalone `GDALDataset` objects. This enables fast random access without reading the entire **BLOB** region.

TACO also supports cloud-optimized access, leveraging additional GDAL VFS handlers such as `/vsicurl/`, `/vsis3/`, `/vsiaz/`, `/vsigs/`, `/vsioss/`, and `/vsiswift/`, ensuring high-performance reads across diverse cloud storage platforms.

#### API

The TACO API consists of two main components: the **Toolbox** (Figure\~\ref{fig\:api\_tacotoolbox}) and the **Reader** (Figure\~\ref{fig\:api\_reader}). The Toolbox provides data classes for the core TACO models—`SAMPLE`, `TORTILLA`, and `TACO`—enabling users to define and modify dataset structures entirely through code. It includes a `create()` method that serializes both data and metadata into fully compliant TACO or TORTILLA files. Additionally, the `edit()` method allows users to update existing files, whether adjusting the `COLLECTION` or the `FOOTER`.

Format conversion is supported through optional utilities such as `tortilla2taco()`, `taco2tortilla()`, `footer2geoparquet()`, and `footer2geoparquetstac()`. Exporters like `collection2stac()`, `collection2croissant()`, `collection2datacite()`, and `collection2datacard()` enable collection-level metadata generation in STAC, Croissant, DataCite, or Markdown formats.

The **Reader** component provides a simple interface to load and interact with TACO and TORTILLA files. It implements a `load()` function that retrieves the `FOOTER` and, if called with `collection=True`, also returns the `COLLECTION`. A `compile()` function must also be provided to create smaller subsets of existing TACO or TORTILLA files.

The Reader is designed to operate within a DataFrame interface in the target environment (e.g., R, Python, or Julia), mapping the `FOOTER` to a DataFrame object. Additionally, a `read` method must be implemented on the DataFrame to expose GDAL VFS access (Figure\~\ref{fig\:api\_reader}). Optional helper functions can also be included to perform sanity checks and validate file compliance with the TACO format specification.
